I've been experimenting with react native... here is the result;

An app that shows the public restrooms in Bergen, and how far you are from them. I got the data from a public dataset on [data.norge.no](https://data.norge.no/). 

Check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/danislu/where-to-wizz)
and download the app on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wheretowizz) or the Apple App Store (comming soon-ish, when i get around to it).
