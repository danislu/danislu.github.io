## Welcome

I'm very __happy__ to introduce my new website!  
It's a static website that I have done in less than 3 hours with this [Hugo tutorial](https://fillmem.com/post/self-hosted-fast-secured-and-free-static-site/)

<pre>
  <code class="language-javascript">
    function func() => list.map((item) => item.stuff);
  </code>
</pre>

<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
  >>> from pygments.styles import get_all_styles
  >>> styles = list(get_all_styles())
  >>> print styles
  </code>
</pre>
